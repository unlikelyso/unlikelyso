                    Tina transformed how our team developed new product directions.
                    Previously we had no shortage of ideas, but any given one required
                    a heavy engineering investment, and we didn't have enough conviction
                    in any single one of them to feel confident investing resources. Tina
                    showed us how to move quickly and iteratively from the highly uncertain
                    brainstorm phase to getting working demos in front of users with as
                    little over-engineering as possible. This gave our team the quantitative
                    and qualitative user feedback we needed to have confidence in where to
                    invest our time and resources.

                Why does my team need external help?
              </span>
              <p>
                When a team has been on working a product for so long, it can be challenging to spot 
                the inefficiencies. Getting an outside perspective from someone who is knoweldgeable
                about product, design and engineering can help to identify alternative approaches to
                speed things up.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="fw-700">
                Wouldn't it be more effective to hire in-house rather than getting external
                consulting help?
              </span>
              <p>
                The team working on the product is deeply invested in its success.
                Because of that, it's important to get help from someone who isn't as
                emotionally attached and can provide a dispassionate perspective to idenfity areas
                for improvement. My focus is in helping teams quickly build products that meet user
                needs.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="fw-700">
                Is there a specific product development framework that we'd use?
              </span>
              <p>
                If minor adjustments can speed up your team's shipping process, we'll focus on those
                rather than a complete overhaul. My pragmatic approach to product development
                and successes with design thinking enhances teams' focus on users and speed in
                making decision-making. Our strategy depends on the goal: if it's to empower the team to
                understand users as deeply as the you do and to make decisions
                independently, then experimenting with a different product development despite a
                significant mental model shift, might be worthwhile.

              <p>
                As part of an in-house innovation team of two, I created an MVP that gained internal
                support, leading to full product development. Despite the typical year-long timeline
                in large companies, our team of four engineers (some part-time) launched the iOS app
                in three months and the Android app the following month.
                <br/><br/>
                In a startup, we initially spent about a year developing a product before adopting
                my approach. Afterward, each pivot took only about 12 weeks, allowing us to quickly
                discard mediocre ideas and focus on those with positive signals.
                <br/><br/>
                Additionally, I've <a href="https://fora.com/blog/failing-to-success/">coached in-house teams</a>,
                transforming a founder-led process into a more team-based approach. Their work
                helped improve key metrics in a similar amount of time and they developed the
                capacity for driving product development, rather than merely executing.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="fw-700">
                Does this apply to adding features to existing products or developing new products?
              </span>
              <p>
                Building minimal prototypes—sometimes with little or no engineering—to quickly
                validate with users in an experiment-driven way can be applied to creating MVPs from
                concepts or enhancing existing experiences.
              </p>
            </li>
           <li>

                What's the expected ROI?
              </span>
              <p>
                The <a href="/the-failed-million-dollar-mvp">traditional product development</a>
                model can take months to years and cost millions. Forming strong hypotheses and
                creating lightweight prototypes to gather frequent user feedback allows teams to
                de-risk and make decisions to pursue or pivot much earlier and with greater
                confidence.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="fw-700">
                What type of business would this be suitable for?
              </span>
              <p>
                While timelines for product development vary by industry, the process of reducing
                risk and finding user-centered solutions remains relevant. We can chat to see if
                this might help your team.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="fw-700">
                Do we have the right team?
              </span>
              <p>
              In the early stages, a functional prototype might not be needed for user feedback, so
              engineering skills may not be required. However, when a functional software prototype
              is necessary, a small team of 3-4 individuals, including engineers, PMs, and
              designers, should be able to build a working front-end and back-end.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="fw-700">
                How long would this take?
              </span>
              <p>
                Starting with a high-level challenge, a team can expect to have conviction in the
                current direction or decide to pivot within 12 weeks. Additional user research may
                extend the timeline, but experiencing the process firsthand allows the team to
                continue iterating or restart with continued coaching.

                      Tina helped turn what could have been a very stressful
                      do-or-die situation at a startup into a period that I look
                      back on as simultaneously one of the most effective and the most
                      fun. She was key to helping our team gel and go from idea to
                      multiple UI prototypes, and then public launch within 2
                      months. Two things stand out that were most helpful to our
                      team: (1) Her incredibly quick but deep user research and
                      synthesis: I have never seen anyone more effectively use
                      user research tools available, and turn qualitative research
                      into something thoughtful and actionable (2) The way she involves
                      the whole team in the entire process: Decision-making was clear
                      and transparent, and involved the team in ways that were helpful
                      but not distracting, and inclusive without being stymied by group
                      decision paralysis.

                      Tina is a powerhouse. She joined us on an in-flight
                      product that hadn't yet found PMF. She quickly took on the
                      vision we were working towards, conducted user research,
                      and developed the user personas and UI prototypes that
                      drove the MVP. Her ability to identify real user needs
                      narrowed the scope and focused everything we were
                      building.

                    I was part of an experimentation stream under Tina's mentorship ... Her approach of asking critical
                    questions, both qualitative and quantitative, along with revisiting her insights
                    and notes from previous experiment streams, significantly improved our team
                    dynamics and flow.

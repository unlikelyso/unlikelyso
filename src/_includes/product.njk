                Creating a minimum viable product can cost millions and take months or years, especially if your team does not have prior experience with new product development.
                The risk of not finding product-market fit is high for any new venture. The faster
                your team can discover dead-ends, the sooner you can pivot, giving you more chances
                to succeed.
                <br /><br />
                Using a lightweight, user-centered, experiment-driven product development process
                that prioritizes short, iterative cycles can help manage the uncertainty of going
                from 0&ndash;1.

                    Tina transformed how our team developed new product directions.
                    Previously we had no shortage of ideas, but any given one required
                    a heavy engineering investment, and we didn't have enough conviction
                    in any single one of them to feel confident investing resources. Tina
                    showed us how to move quickly and iteratively from the highly uncertain
                    brainstorm phase to getting working demos in front of users with as
                    little over-engineering as possible. This gave our team the quantitative
                    and qualitative user feedback we needed to have confidence in where to
                    invest our time and resources.

              <p>
                New product development takes a significant mental, emotional and physical toll and
                is very difficult if you haven’t done it before. Working with someone who is
                experienced in the process and has guided teams ensures that the team can manage the
                uncertainty and stay on track.

              </span>
              <p>
                Hiring an external consulting firm may result in strategies that gather dust if the
                team is not prepared to execute them. Instead, <a
                href="/the-failed-million-dollar-mvp">investing in your team</a> will

                It depends on the process. The one that that we would use has significant benefits and is fast-paced.

                Timelines for new product development can be different for different industries, but
                the process of reducing risk and systematically figuring out the best user-centered
                solutions remains applicable. Let’s chat and find out.

              <p>
                In the early stages, a functional prototype might not be needed to get feedback from
                users so engineering skills may not be required. If it is needed, the team needs to
                be able to build a working front-end, and back-end, and have some ability to create
                designs and assess the market (or is willing to learn as needed). This could mean a
                small team of 3-4 consisting of any combination of engineers, PMs, and designers as
                long as they have the capabilities covered.

              </span>
              <p>
                In 12 weeks, a team can expect to have conviction in the current direction or decide
                to pursue a different line of thought. If additional exploratory user research is
                needed, that may extend the timeline.

                      Tina helped turn what could have been a very stressful
                      do-or-die situation at a startup into a period that I look
                      back on as simultaneously one of the most effective and the most
                      fun. She was key to helping our team gel and go from idea to
                      multiple UI prototypes, and then public launch within 2
                      months. Two things stand out that were most helpful to our
                      team: (1) Her incredibly quick but deep user research and
                      synthesis: I have never seen anyone more effectively use
                      user research tools available, and turn qualitative research
                      into something thoughtful and actionable (2) The way she involves
                      the whole team in the entire process: Decision-making was clear
                      and transparent, and involved the team in ways that were helpful
                      but not distracting, and inclusive without being stymied by group
                      decision paralysis.

                      Tina is a powerhouse. She joined us on an in-flight
                      product that hadn't yet found PMF. She quickly took on the
                      vision we were working towards, conducted user research,
                      and developed the user personas and UI prototypes that
                      drove the MVP. Her ability to identify real user needs
                      narrowed the scope and focused everything we were
                      building. She's a delightful collaborator. Tina's high
                      energy, sense of humor, openness, and eagerness to share
                      and train others are all critical assets in the ups and
                      downs of startup life.

                    I was part of an experimentation stream under Tina's mentorship. She
                    played a pivotal role in helping us discover our strengths, voice our concerns,
                    and navigate our way to delivering results. Her approach of asking critical
                    questions, both qualitative and quantitative, along with revisiting her insights
                    and notes from previous experiment streams, significantly improved our team
                    dynamics and flow. Working with Tina was not only professionally rewarding
                    but also a great deal of fun.

              My expertise is in user experience design, with focus on new
              product development. I have been called the “tip of the spear”
              because I thrive in ambiguous environments and bring clarity and
              direction in the search for product-market fit.
            </p>

            <p class="ts-fs-6 mb-20">
              Having spent 15+ years in startups and big companies as well as
              exploring entrepreneurship, I am well-versed in building things
              from scratch in extremely nebulous and fast-paced environments,
              whether my title is Director of Emerging Products or VP Design. I
              know how to adapt and be nimble in highly structured
              organizations. My intimate familiarity with risk and failure
              enables me to manage them well — I do not suffer from decision
              paralysis.
            </p>

            <p class="ts-fs-6 mb-20">
              My prior experience as a software engineer, product manager, and
              product designer fuels my conviction in the importance of the
              equal partnership of Engineering, Product, and Design (EPD) as the
              cornerstone of product development, especially when going from
              0-1.
            </p>

            <p class="ts-fs-6 mb-20">
              Given the inherent difficulty of new ventures, I’ve found that
              effective team communication is crucial to its success — I’ve
              taught teams interpersonal communication gleaned from my reflected
              experiences, applying the lessons from Interpersonal Dynamics at
              Stanford. My efforts have fostered open communication and the
              giving and receiving of feedback to create a culture of trust and
              safety.
            </p>

            <p class="ts-fs-6 mb-20">
              In addition to building products from the ground up, I love
              figuring out what brings people joy at work and how to help them
              thrive, creating environments that encourage learning and growth.

                    Tina transformed how our team developed new product directions.
                    Previously we had no shortage of ideas, but any given one required
                    a heavy engineering investment, and we didn't have enough conviction
                    in any single one of them to feel confident investing resources. Tina
                    showed us how to move quickly and iteratively from the highly uncertain
                    brainstorm phase to getting working demos in front of users with as
                    little over-engineering as possible. This gave our team the quantitative
                    and qualitative user feedback we needed to have confidence in where to
                    invest our time and resources.

                  Tina helped turn what could have been a very stressful
                  do-or-die situation at a startup into a period that I look
                  back on as simultaneously one of the most effective and the most
                  fun. She was key to helping our team gel and go from idea to
                  multiple UI prototypes, and then public launch within 2
                  months. Two things stand out that were most helpful to our
                  team: (1) Her incredibly quick but deep user research and
                  synthesis: I have never seen anyone more effectively use
                  user research tools available, and turn qualitative research
                  into something thoughtful and actionable (2) The way she involves
                  the whole team in the entire process: Decision-making was clear
                  and transparent, and involved the team in ways that were helpful
                  but not distracting, and inclusive without being stymied by group
                  decision paralysis.

                      Tina is a powerhouse. She joined us on an in-flight

                      vision we were working towards, conducted user research,
                      and developed the user personas and UI prototypes that
                      drove the MVP. Her ability to identify real user needs
                      narrowed the scope and focused everything we were
                      building. She's a delightful collaborator. Tina's high
                      energy, sense of humor, openness, and eagerness to share
                      and train others are all critical assets in the ups and

                        I took the interpersonal communications workshop led
                        by Tina.  I learned important lessons around how to
                        effectively communicate in difficult situations and how
                        to manage my own feelings in such situations to be able
                        to ultimately move forward.  This is by no means an easy
                        thing to do and Tina knew this; this is why she would
                        gently probe us to practice on the spot with other
                        individuals to solidify such a skillset.  Tina taught
                        the workshop in true Tina style - ensuring everyone felt
                        comfortable while simultaneously pushing us out of our
                        comfort zone. Her authentic approach and general desire
                        to make sure everyone came out of the workshop with
                        something was evident and appreciated throughout. To
                        this day, when I get upset (whether at home or at work) I
                        take a breath, think about the template of how to communicate
                        in such situations and go from there. It’s been a
                        real game changer!

                      approaching tough conversations, and I truly appreciated the
                      thoughtful approach Tina maintained throughout the entire program.
                      Each time I participated in the workshop (yes, I attended more
                      than once!), I felt that Tina created a safe space for everyone
                      to share and learn together. I walked away from Tina’s workshop

                      Tina played a pivotal role in my professional and personal
                      development.  She genuinely cared for each team member’s
                      growth, and she ensured that the projects I was involved
                      in aligned with my aspirations as a Product Designer. Tina
                      has a remarkable ability to create an environment where everyone feels
                      comfortable opening up for candid and meaningful conversations.

                      A particularly memorable experience was participating in an
                      interpersonal communications workshop&mdash; it provided a structured
                      framework for navigating challenging conversations in a professional
                      setting. The practice sessions in small groups were particularly
                      helpful, because they allowed us to engage in honest communication
                      outside our regular work settings, which helped create a safe and
                      trusting environment within the team. Tina's leadership in this
                      workshop reinforced her commitment to fostering effective communication
                      and building strong interpersonal relationships within our team.

                      Tina unlocked something in me. In a few short months, I’ve
                      grown more as a designer than I ever had in my career! Tina’s
                      mentoring approach is to steer you in directions that may not be
                      comfortable, but ultimately manifest in that "aha moment" with a
                      stronger solution. But the most valuable lesson was the communication
                      framework she left me with, I became a more effective communicator
                      and I’ve also noticed a culture shift within the team that made
                      giving and receiving feedback a natural and liberating experience.

                      have shaped her into a powerhouse with lots of insights to share.
                      In addition to her research and design skillset, she has an uncanny
                      ability to quickly assess team dynamics and identify and leverage

              As a leader in a later stage startup or established organization
              in tech, you aim to innovate and expand the business beyond its
              core offerings. To achieve this, you recognize the need to
              delegate decisions to your team and avoid being a bottleneck.
              However, this can be challenging if your team is not accustomed to
              navigating the ambiguity of new product development and is used to
              working with a clear roadmap.
            </p>
            <p class="ts-fs-6">
              Instead of relying on external firms, your goal is to develop the
              capability for creating new product offerings in-house. You
              believe that your team is your competitive advantage and want to
              invest in their growth and talent. To enable your team members to
              take ownership and execute independently, they need to be
              empowered to fail quickly and learn from their mistakes. This can
              be achieved through coaching. Once your team becomes proficient in
              the new product development process, achieving product-market fit
              in a fast and cost-effective manner will not be unlikely.

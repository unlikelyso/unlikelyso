                    As a startup founder and CEO, and public company exec, Tina was one of my most
                    trusted advisors.  Good managers solve hard problems.  Tina goes one step
                    further.  She builds trust and digs into the personal whys (she is one of the
                    most authentic people I've met) but is also pragmatic – she prioritizes the
                    company first, followed by the team, then the individual.  This gave us a deeper
                    understanding of our business and helped us make better decisions.

                    Tina transformed how our team developed new product directions.
                    Previously we had no shortage of ideas, but any given one required
                    a heavy engineering investment, and we didn't have enough conviction
                    in any single one of them to feel confident investing resources. Tina
                    showed us how to move quickly and iteratively from the highly uncertain
                    brainstorm phase to getting working demos in front of users with as
                    little over-engineering as possible. This gave our team the quantitative
                    and qualitative user feedback we needed to have confidence in where to
                    invest our time and resources.

                      Tina is a powerhouse. She joined us on an in-flight
                      product that hadn't yet found PMF. She quickly took on the
                      vision we were working towards, conducted user research,
                      and developed the user personas and UI prototypes that
                      drove the MVP. Her ability to identify real user needs
                      narrowed the scope and focused everything we were
                      building. She's a delightful collaborator. Tina's high
                      energy, sense of humor, openness, and eagerness to share
                      and train others are all critical assets in the ups and

                      Tina helped turn what could have been a very stressful
                      do-or-die situation at a startup into a period that I look
                      back on as simultaneously one of the most effective and the most
                      fun. She was key to helping our team gel and go from idea to
                      multiple UI prototypes, and then public launch within 2
                      months. Two things stand out that were most helpful to our
                      team: (1) Her incredibly quick but deep user research and
                      synthesis: I have never seen anyone more effectively use
                      user research tools available, and turn qualitative research
                      into something thoughtful and actionable (2) The way she involves
                      the whole team in the entire process: Decision-making was clear
                      and transparent, and involved the team in ways that were helpful
                      but not distracting, and inclusive without being stymied by group
                      decision paralysis.

                        I took the interpersonal communications workshop led
                        by Tina.  I learned important lessons around how to
                        effectively communicate in difficult situations and how
                        to manage my own feelings in such situations to be able
                        to ultimately move forward.  This is by no means an easy
                        thing to do and Tina knew this; this is why she would
                        gently probe us to practice on the spot with other
                        individuals to solidify such a skillset.  Tina taught
                        the workshop in true Tina style - ensuring everyone felt
                        comfortable while simultaneously pushing us out of our
                        comfort zone. Her authentic approach and general desire
                        to make sure everyone came out of the workshop with
                        something was evident and appreciated throughout. To
                        this day, when I get upset (whether at home or at work) I
                        take a breath, think about the template of how to communicate
                        in such situations and go from there. It’s been a
                        real game changer!

                      I thoroughly enjoyed the interpersonal communications workshop
                      led by Tina Nguyen. The discussion included a framework for
                      approaching tough conversations, and I truly appreciated the
                      thoughtful approach Tina maintained throughout the entire program.
                      Each time I participated in the workshop (yes, I attended more
                      than once!), I felt that Tina created a safe space for everyone
                      to share and learn together. I walked away from Tina’s workshop
                      with an enhanced communications skillset, all thanks to her
                      wonderful guidance.

                      Tina played a pivotal role in my professional and personal
                      development.  She genuinely cared for each team member’s
                      growth, and she ensured that the projects I was involved
                      in aligned with my aspirations as a Product Designer. Tina
                      has a remarkable ability to create an environment where everyone feels
                      comfortable opening up for candid and meaningful conversations.

                      A particularly memorable experience was participating in an
                      interpersonal communications workshop &mdash; it provided a structured
                      framework for navigating challenging conversations in a professional
                      setting. The practice sessions in small groups were particularly
                      helpful, because they allowed us to engage in honest communication
                      outside our regular work settings, which helped create a safe and
                      trusting environment within the team. Tina's leadership in this
                      workshop reinforced her commitment to fostering effective communication
                      and building strong interpersonal relationships within our team.

                      grown more as a designer than I ever had in my career! Tina’s
                      mentoring approach is to steer you in directions that may not be
                      comfortable, but ultimately manifest in that "aha moment" with a
                      stronger solution. But the most valuable lesson was the communication
                      framework she left me with, I became a more effective communicator
                      and I’ve also noticed a culture shift within the team that made
                      giving and receiving feedback a natural and liberating experience.

                      In addition to her research and design skillset, she has an uncanny

                    Tina's guidance on tackling challenging conversations, providing constructive
                    feedback, and handling disagreements was especially noteworthy. Her advice was
                    practical and directly applicable, which we could immediately put into practice
                    through live pairing and scenario role-playing. Thanks to this workshop, I now
                    have a better framework for approaching interpersonal communications. Beyond the
                    workshop, I was part of an experimentation stream under Tina's mentorship. She
                    played a pivotal role in helping us discover our strengths, voice our concerns,
                    and navigate our way to delivering results. Her approach of asking critical
                    questions, both qualitative and quantitative, along with revisiting her insights
                    and notes from previous experiment streams, significantly improved our team
                    dynamics and flow. Working with Tina was not only professionally rewarding
                    but also a great deal of fun. She is an outstanding manager and a cooperative
                    team player, whose contributions have left a lasting impression on me and my colleagues.

                      I attended Tina's Interpersonal Comms Workshop recently and it was really interesting!
                      The workshop has provided me with a guiding mental map that I use when I need to have
                      hard conversations at work. In the past I felt uncomfortable starting difficult
                      conversations because of the uncertainty around how the other person would react, or
                      uncertainty on the best way to present my thoughts. This workshop provided me with a
                      template for planning hard conversations. It also helped me understand the danger zones
                      that could cause negative or unintended reactions during a hard conversation. I am a Senior Software
                      Engineer (8 years experience), but I've never been taught this before. Given how
                      crucial conversations are in my field, I think all engineering organizations should
                      provide training for handling hard conversations.

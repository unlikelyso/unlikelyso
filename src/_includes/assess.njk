                  As a product leader, you have conviction in your vision but may struggle to fully
                  translate that vision into action. Figuring out the underlying problems affecting
                  the team can be challenging, as everyone may have different views

                Working with a partner with operational experience in both early-stage startups and

                situation, an assessment of existing team gaps, and recommendations to
                improve your organization's new product development capabilities.

              </span>
              <p>
                I have deep operational experience in early-stage startups, spanning product, design,
                and engineering. In addition, I've gained unofficial experience in marketing,
                branding, copywriting, and more&mdash;whatever it takes to ship fast. My diverse experiences and
                successes in process improvement provides me a unique ability to see through different
                lenses and figure out the root causes. I can also help the team to
                implement the recommendations, ensuring they are not merely left as strategies
                collecting dust.

              </span>
              <p>
                My extensive training and experience in listening to users, understanding their
                unspoken needs, and designing experiences that address those needs enable me to do
                the same for your team. I developed my <a href="/communication-coaching">communication coaching</a> 
                approach while working with teams
                navigating the <a href="https://fora.com/blog/failing-to-success/">challenges of going from 0 to 1</a> 
                for the first time, tailoring my methods to suit their specific situation.
                Our collaboration will be a co-creation process, with ample feedback from both you
                and your team.

              <p>
                I am self-aware enough to recognize when additional help is needed and candid enough
                to tell you. If necessary, I can refer you to other leaders in engineering, product,
                <a href="https://www.melindachung.com/consulting">marketing</a>, executive coaching, and other areas who might be able to help you.

                Can't the team just work faster or more?
              </span>
              <p>
                Challenges in shipping quickly are rarely (if ever) caused by teams not working hard
                enough or fast enough, from my experience. If anything, they might be working too
                much and burning out. Very often, the lack of focus and and shifting priorities
                compete for their attention, among other challenges. So no, that won't help.

            <li>
              <span class="fw-700">
                Won't you just tell me that I need help with design, team communication and product
                development?
              </span>
              <p>
                Broadly speaking, most teams could benefit from all three. Given
                unlimited time, we could achieve many things. Where I am most effective is in
                uncovering real needs and prioritizing for the best outcomes given limited time and
                resources. The real value lies in the practical details of what we can achieve given
                the constraints.

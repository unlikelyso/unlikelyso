                  As a product leader, you have conviction in your vision but may struggle to fully
                  translate that vision into action. Figuring out the underlying problems affecting
                  the team can be challenging, as everyone may have different views
                  but not the whole picture.

                Working with a partner with operational experience in both early-stage startups and
                established companies, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of your current
                situation, an assessment of existing team gaps, and recommendations to
                improve your organization's new product development capabilities.

                    As a startup founder and CEO, and public company exec, Tina was one of my most
                    trusted advisors.Â  Good managers solve hard problems.Â  Tina goes one step
                    further.Â  She builds trust and digs into the personal whys (she is one of the
                    most authentic people I've met) but is also pragmaticÂ âÂ she prioritizes the
                    company first, followed by the team, then the individual.Â  This gave us a deeper
                    understanding of our business and helped us make better decisions.

                How is this different from other consulting engagements?
              </span>
              <p>
                I have deep operational early-stage startup experience in product, design, 
                engineering. Not to mention the unofficial marketing, branding, copywriting
                experiences, and more â whatever it takes to ship fast. My official training, diverse experiences and
                successes in changing processes gives me a unique ability to assess from different
                perspectives and figure out the underlying issues. I can also help the team to
                implement the recommendations, instead of delivering just a strategy that might
                collect dust if the team is not prepared to address them.

              <p>
                I am aware enough to know when more help is needed and candid enough to tell you. I
                can refer you to other leaders in engineering, product, marketing, executive
                coaching, etc. who might be able to help.

              </span>
              <p>
                Challenges in shipping quickly are rarely (if ever) caused by teams not working hard
                enough or fast enough, from my experience. If anything, they might be working too
                much and burning out. Very often, the lack of focus and and shifting priorities
                compete for their attention, among other challenges. So no, it won't help.

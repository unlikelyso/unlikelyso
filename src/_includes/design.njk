                You don't yet have a permanent head of design and might not be ready for one.
                Instead of relying on infrequent feedback and help from your network, you want 
                consistent guidance from an expert who understands the challenges of creating great
                UX in early and growth-stage startups. Incorporating great UX practices into the DNA of
                your company begins now before the company scales and systemic

                What type of designer do I need?
              </span>
              <p>
                It’s challenging to find a designer who is good at the entire spectrum of
                design, ranging from user research, interaction design, visual design, branding,
                etc. So it depends on the challenges that you’re currently trying to solve. For
                example, if your team has strong user research capabilities, you could choose a
                designer who is stronger with interaction design or visual design. Though, more
                often, startup teams tend to overlook the <a
                href="/top-10-mistakes-startups-make-in-user-research-without-a-designer/">importance of user research.</a>

              <span class="fw-700">
                How do I evaluate design candidates?
              </span>
              <p>
                It takes an experienced designer to evaluate other designers. It’s also important
                that the person evaluating the designer can tell the difference between someone who
                is used to designing in big companies versus startups. Experience in either comes with
                advantages and challenges. It doesn’t mean that you should only hire candidates with
                startup experience. With either, there might be some mental shifts that need to
                happen for the designer to be able to do their best work.

              <span class="fw-700">
                How do I get my team, that has never worked with a great designer, to appreciate design?
              </span>
              <p>
                If your company is
                still in its early stages and doesn’t yet have a designer, finding the right first
                hire is crucial. Or finding an experienced design leader who you can partner with in
                your effort. Appreciation comes from working with a competent designer who will need
                your help to champion their efforts.

                How can designers at startups benefit from coaching?
              </span>
              <p>
                Startups, especially early-stage ones, have unique qualities that might be foreign
                to designers who have never worked in such an environment before. If the company
                does not have strong design leadership, the designer’s growth could stall. In
                order to do their best work and meet the needs of a growing startup, having a mentor
                who understands the ins and outs of the startup environment and its needs will help
                tremendously.

                      Tina played a pivotal role in my professional and personal
                      development.  She genuinely cared for each team member’s
                      growth, and she ensured that the projects I was involved
                      in aligned with my aspirations as a Product Designer.

                      Tina unlocked something in me. In a few short months, I’ve
                      grown more as a designer than I ever had in my career! Tina’s
                      mentoring approach is to steer you in directions that may not be
                      comfortable, but ultimately manifest in that "aha moment" with a
                      stronger solution.

                      I had the pleasure of working with Tina and was consistently
                      impressed by her project management, design leadership,
                      and user-centric mindset. As a product design leader with a
                      deep knowledge of best practices, Tina's expertise and
                      dedication were invaluable to the team.

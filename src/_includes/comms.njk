                  Disagreements and interpersonal tension are preventing your team from shipping
                  quickly. As the product leader, you need them to get past the storming phase and

                  Team cohesion is of utmost importance and is most at risk in fast-paced
                  environments where friction is highly disruptive. Instead of avoiding tough
                  conversations, work with a partner who has
                  firsthand experience with the stresses of their work to coach them to resolve
                  their disagreements and focus on shipping.

                  Tina's communication workshop takes the scariness out of what any team of humans
                  goes through when working together &mdash; emotions. She had us put the concepts we had
                  just learned into immediate practice by replaying past conversations that could
                  have gone better. Doing this as a team and openly discussing the scenarios gave us
                  a stable common ground that we can build on when future moments of tension
                  inevitably arise.

              <p>
                If your team works on new product development, this is essential even if it may not
                seem like it. In other situations, some signals include: the team doesn't seem to
                have many disagreements, team members are quiet and do not voice dissent, elephants
                in the room are ignored, there are major organizational changes, or the team
                struggles with execution.

                Why would learning how to give and receive feedback help?
              </span>
              <p>
                Effective communication keeps the team healthy and working smoothly. It prevents
                frustrations from building up and team members from burning out or quitting
                abruptly, which would hinder progress in product development.

                What framework would we learn?
              </span>
              <p>
                We'll use a framework for giving and receiving feedback aligned with Nonviolent
                Communication (NVC) and Stanford's Interpersonal Dynamics (Touchy Feely), both
                well-established methods with a proven track record of improving communication.

                How is this different from other communication workshops?
              </span>
              <p>
                With over 10 years of experience facing similar challenges in startups and other
                fast-paced environments, I intimately understand these difficulties. My 
                personal experience applying the framework in such situations has transformed
                stressful moments into productive learning experiences that strengthen
                relationships. Disagreements are unavoidable, but we're not powerless
                to change them.

                Will we be able to communicate more effectively?  
              </span>
              <p>
                I have spent over 100 hours in T-groups and work situations giving and
                receiving feedback. I have has also trained over 50 people, helping to improve their
                team communication. The team will learn the theory and practice applying it. Like
                any skill, communication will improve with continuous practice, and will become easier
                over time.
              </p>
            </li>
 
            <li>
              <span class="fw-700">
                Why is this beneficial?
              </span>
              <p>
                Managing people challenges is often more demanding and emotionally taxing than
                dealing with technical issues. While team members may have trained for years in
                engineering, design, and other technical areas, many have never learned this
                essential skill. To advance to senior roles, team members must be able to build
                strong working relationships.

                      I thoroughly enjoyed the interpersonal communications workshop
                      led by Tina Nguyen. The discussion included a framework for
                      approaching tough conversations, and I truly appreciated the
                      thoughtful approach Tina maintained throughout the entire program.
                      Each time I participated in the workshop (yes, I attended more
                      than once!), I felt that Tina created a safe space for everyone
                      to share and learn together. I walked away from Tina’s workshop
                      with an enhanced communications skillset, all thanks to her
                      wonderful guidance.

                        I took the interpersonal communications workshop led
                        by Tina.  I learned important lessons around how to
                        effectively communicate in difficult situations and how
                        to manage my own feelings in such situations to be able
                        to ultimately move forward.  This is by no means an easy
                        thing to do and Tina knew this; this is why she would
                        gently probe us to practice on the spot with other
                        individuals to solidify such a skillset.  Tina taught
                        the workshop in true Tina style - ensuring everyone felt
                        comfortable while simultaneously pushing us out of our
                        comfort zone. Her authentic approach and general desire
                        to make sure everyone came out of the workshop with
                        something was evident and appreciated throughout. To
                        this day, when I get upset (whether at home or at work) I
                        take a breath, think about the template of how to communicate
                        in such situations and go from there. It’s been a
                        real game changer!

                    I recently had the privilege of attending an interpersonal communications
                    workshop led by Tina. This session was a key
                    part of our professional development program and had a significant impact on my
                    approach to workplace communication.  Tina's guidance on tackling challenging
                    conversations, providing constructive feedback, and handling disagreements was
                    especially noteworthy. Her advice was practical and directly applicable, which
                    we could immediately put into practice through live pairing and scenario
                    role-playing. Thanks to this workshop, I now have a better framework for
                    approaching interpersonal communications.

                      I attended Tina's Interpersonal Comms Workshop recently and it was really interesting!
                      The workshop has provided me with a guiding mental map that I use when I need to have
                      hard conversations at work. In the past I felt uncomfortable starting difficult
                      conversations because of the uncertainty around how the other person would react, or
                      uncertainty on the best way to present my thoughts. This workshop provided me with a
                      template for planning hard conversations. It also helped me understand the danger zones
                      that could cause negative or unintended reactions during a hard conversation. I am a Senior Software
                      Engineer (8 years experience), but I've never been taught this before. Given how
                      crucial conversations are in my field, I think all engineering organizations should
                      provide training for handling hard conversations.

                      A particularly memorable experience was participating in an
                      interpersonal communications workshop &mdash; it provided a structured
                      framework for navigating challenging conversations in a professional
                      setting. The practice sessions in small groups were particularly
                      helpful, because they allowed us to engage in honest communication
                      outside our regular work settings, which helped create a safe and
                      trusting environment within the team. Tina's leadership in this
                      workshop reinforced her commitment to fostering effective communication
                      and building strong interpersonal relationships within our team.

There is no single path to success in new product development, but it can feel like there is only
one way (whether at a startup or a big company) — that of the founders or executives. For these
teams, it can feel like a tightrope walk where any departure from leadership’s vision will lead to
failure. Despite a desire to “fail fast, fail often,” most teams do not actually succeed in that
aspiration, investing millions and wasting months or years. I’ve experienced both the traditional
exec-led product development model and a team-led one. Each of these models has merits, but neither
can guarantee product-market fit. I favor the team-led model because of the positive impact that it
can have in uniting a team, encouraging them to stretch beyond their comfort zone and do their best
work — where both company and personal growth goals align. There are some challenges to work through
in either of these models that early startup teams (founders and a few members) should consider when
evaluating the right approach for them.

<h5 class="ts-fs-5 fw-800 mt-24 mb-16">Pressure</h5>

In the exec-led model of new product development, there is immense pressure on the founders or
executives to convince team members of the validity of their vision. If a PM lead exists on the
team, their job is to make the product that leadership has envisioned successful — the solution has
been decided. This exerts enormous pressure on team members to buy in, despite misgivings, and
to commit wholly to building out that vision. I’ve experienced both sides of this model. As a team
member, I’ve participated in prolonged debates with leadership who seemed unmoved by the concerns
raised by the team. Unable to change leadership’s mind and exhausted from frequent
debates, the team reluctantly falls in line and builds out the vision despite lingering doubts.
<br/><br/>

Having acted as the product lead in startup and big company environments, I’ve felt the tremendous
weight of trying to steer the team toward success — there was
never much room for failure. Perceived stumbles resulted in decreased faith from jittery executives
in other parts of the company who sought resources for their own teams. Failure meant the project's
cancellation at a big company. At a startup, a shortened runway and the looming
dissolution of the company.
<br/><br/>

There is a tremendous expectation to reach certainty as soon as possible and heavy discomfort with
the inherent ambiguity of early-stage product development. This unspoken need from the team and
external stakeholders (e.g. executives, board members, investors, founders) converge on the acting
product lead, making it unwise for them to acknowledge doubt, even though it might be appropriate,
leading to dissatisfaction for all involved. There is immense stress on everyone when the
expectation is to succeed even though that’s typically not the outcome given how often
<a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/why-start-ups-fail">new ventures fail.</a>
<br/><br/>

I've also practiced a more iterative, team-led approach to new product development modeled after the design thinking process, as taught by 
<a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/getting-started-with-design-thinking">the Stanford d.school</a>
and practiced by IDEO. In this user-centered, experiment-driven model, team members share ownership
and the responsibility of finding product-market fit. There are discussions, but instead of lengthy
debates, continuous user feedback on iterated prototypes settles many disagreements. This
lightweight process allows team members to take comfort in the structure of how to go about
discovering user needs and potential solutions. Failure doesn't have as much of an emotional punch
because it is part of the learning process. The uncertainty decreases as the team iterates based on
frequent user feedback. In one of my experiences, the prototype that showed the most promise did not
come from leadership. Instead, two team members created it, riffing on each other's ideas. We still
felt pressure to succeed, but it was a weight that we all shared. There was joint problem-solving
and a shared sense of adventure — it was even fun. We were a team trying to figure out a way forward
together rather than just a group of colleagues doing their jobs.
<br/><br/><br/>

<br/>

<h5 class="ts-fs-5 fw-800 mt-24 mb-16">Time and money</h5>

In the traditional exec-led model, creating an MVP can take nine months to 1.5 years or more before
leadership decides to continue investing or end the project. Without a clear positive result, the
project will likely languish as the team works on other priorities. The company will have spent
millions on unclear returns.
<br/><br/>

For example, a startup with eight members may spend a year building an MVP. The company
conservatively spends ~$1.4M (assuming an average salary of $175k) on headcount alone. Similar teams
at a big company would take even longer. All this means is higher sunk costs. If the effort is
successful, then all is well, but it often is not. What the team learns in the process is lost when
they are reassigned to other projects. What is certain is only that they failed.
<br/><br/>

In contrast, the team-led model encourages quicker experiments and iterations based on user
feedback, so in 12 weeks, the team should be able to validate several hypotheses, discover where
they might have been wrong, and adjust course. The team can build on their past findings — failures
aren't bad because they're just learnings. If there isn’t a way forward — as in one of my
experiences — then the call to stop happens earlier. The cost of these learnings in both time and
money is significantly less than in the traditional product development model. If this approach has
a potentially higher ROI, why do most teams follow the exec-led model?
<br/><br/><br/>

<br/>

<h5 class="ts-fs-5 fw-800 mt-24 mb-16">Certainty, security, and clarity</h5>

Being a part of a team with a leader with a clear vision brings a sense of security. This top-down
approach is reassuring because the product leaders know what they’re doing (at least, they project
that confidence). Team members only need to worry about execution. Product managers take on more
project management responsibilities rather than needing to figure out product-market fit. This
command-control approach works well when there are strong signals for product-market fit. However,
the certainty and security might be short-lived if that is not true.
<br/><br/>

In the best-case scenario, the solution dictated by leadership finds product-market fit. The company
grows and is successful for awhile. At some point, continuing with this top-down process may hinder
scalability and innovation because executives become the bottleneck for decision-making. The
business becomes vulnerable to stagnation and competitive threats. User growth and revenue can
flatten or decline (e.g. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/15/business/instant-brands-bankruptcy.html">Instant Pot</a>),
and smaller, faster-executing companies can 
<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/why-startups-are-more-successful-than-ever-at-unbundling-incumbents">overtake market share</a>. 
To remain nimble, companies need to innovate. One such way is to train internal teams in new product
development. Leadership can teach team members to make decisions and be okay with failing if it
means learning. Seasoned leaders may find it hard to trust that the team can make good decisions (as
good as they can) and cannot let go. The team may end up in this quasi-autonomous state where they
make decisions but are then second-guessed, never having the autonomy to make mistakes. It is as
much a learning experience for leadership to delegate as for team members to assume ownership and
responsibility.
<br/><br/>

In the team-led model, team members who are not used to having so much autonomy, even if it is something that they desire, may
<a href="http://fora.com/blog/failing-to-success/">become frustrated</a>. 
Prior early-stage product development experience or expert guidance helps the team manage
uncertainty and avoid becoming stalled. Those who are product-oriented and want to experience the
impact of their efforts first-hand do their best work under this model.
<br/><br/>

<h5 class="ts-fs-5 fw-800 mt-24 mb-16">When does that team-led model work?</h5>

There are a few scenarios where this team-led approach to product development shines:
<br/><br/>
<ol>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">
      An early-stage startup team consisting of founders and a few team members.
    </span>
    <p>
      Many people are attracted to joining startups because of the potential for impact and the
      opportunity to learn things that would not be available to them in a big company. Inviting
      them to fully participate in the process as thought partners makes the best use of their drive
      and energy, while the founders are still hands-on. If initial efforts aren't fruitful, the
      team will learn and will have learned to fail together, making them more effective in
      subsequent efforts. When the team is successful, the company will have multiple trusted team
      members capable of driving product development as the company scales.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">
      A team in a growth-stage startup when the founders can no longer make
      day-to-day product decisions.
    </span>
    <p>
      This inflection point is a good time for the founders to select talented team members who can
      lead and train them to make decisions that jive with the original vision. Although the
      founders cannot be as actively involved as they had been in the early stages of the startup,
      they can still provide significant guidance in steering the team toward a desired goal. The
      team needs to experience the ups and downs of new product development and have the leeway to
      make and learn from their mistakes. This way, the founders can gain confidence that the team
      can make quick decisions and keep mistakes cheap.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">
      An in-house team in a large company can be tasked to experiment and create potential new product lines. 
    </span>
    <p>
      There are likely team members in the organization who yearn for the experience of creating new
      products but who may need more guided opportunities to learn. These team members are
      well-trained in their craft and just need coaching through the experimentation process. Given
      that the company has a stable, growing core product, such an investment would be worthwhile to
      mitigate the risk of stagnation.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

New product development can mean creating entirely new products or adding new features to an
existing product. Instead of getting caught up in lengthy and complex MVP phases, companies
(regardless of size and stage) can prioritize short, iterative cycles with clear goals and
hypotheses. Instead of doggedly building out a full-fledged MVP that may not yield desired results,
the team will have three more cycles (assuming the average of a year-long cycle) to attempt to do so
versus one cycle and a much longer runway.
<br/><br/>

There is no silver bullet to <a href="https://review.firstround.com/series/product-market-fit/">success in product development</a>.
Failures are disappointing, but we can
alleviate their impact by learning concrete lessons about users and the market. When there is room
to fail, there is more room for risk-taking and creativity and better chances for innovation.
Startups shy away from having a process for new product development because of the connotation of
bureaucracy and slowness, but the de facto exec-led process exists regardless. A lightweight process
acknowledges and alleviates the anxiety of uncertainty and ambiguity.  By changing the experience,
leadership can approach new product development in a structured, user-centered manner that fully
utilizes the potential and skills of the entire team, thus inspiring and energizing them in growing
the business and their own professional and personal growth.

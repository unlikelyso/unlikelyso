How does it happen that someone becomes an a-hole at work? It’s hard to believe that anyone would
begin their day gleefully planning how they might destroy someone else’s. Yet a-holes certainly
exist — we’ve all worked with them at some point.
<br/><br/>
You know who they are. 
<br/><br/>
What made them that way in your eyes? Did they take credit for your work? Have no regard for your
time by scheduling or canceling meetings at the last minute, expecting you to drop everything? Did
they throw you under the bus or engage in blaming when things didn’t go well? Spread lies about you
behind your back? The a-holes that I’ve worked with wielded their power like a cudgel and expected
me to fall in line.
<br/><br/>
Whatever their transgression was, I bet you remember how they made you feel. I felt dismissed and
disrespected. Whatever enthusiasm or motivation I had was sledgehammered until I dreaded work. A
short 10-minute drive to the office became a slog toward Mt. Doom. Easy things became hard. Hard
things made me weigh how much my sanity was worth. Sleep became a casualty. My sense of well-being
nosedived, making it difficult to enjoy much of anything, even outside of work.
<br/><br/>
Despite their harmful behavior, a-holes are tolerated or, worse, celebrated or promoted. No one
calls them out. Sometimes, they’re our bosses or someone higher up in the management chain — they
only behave like a-holes to peers or those lower on the totem pole — which makes accountability for
their behavior even more unlikely. They create unsafe environments where we are on guard, forcing us
to adopt a CYA (cover-your-ass) attitude. Work is miserable because of the toxic environment that
they create. We intuitively recognize toxic culture when we dread coming to work. Our mental health
erodes the longer that we are there. Toxic behaviors, as defined in <a
href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-every-leader-needs-to-worry-about-toxic-culture/">“Why Every Leader Needs to Worry
About Toxic Culture,”</a> are disrespectful, noninclusive, unethical, cutthroat, and/or abusive. Yet how
can work be toxic if it’s not something any of us want to create?
<br/><br/>
Most of us aspire to be rational, logical, and data-driven (especially in tech). We tend to seek
numbers and hard evidence and disregard intangible things like feelings. We control our emotions —
often by denying that we have them — and are proud that we can hide them.
<br/><br/>
Can we though? 
<br/><br/>
Whether or not we admit to them, we have feelings. Those seemingly controlled emotions leak despite
our best efforts. Others are often aware of our emotional state, even if we are stone-faced. They
may not be able to pinpoint the reasons for our feelings but will sense it. Think about the last
time you realized something was “off” with a colleague despite their not having said anything
specific. Our repressed emotions run amok and cause us to act in ways antithetical to creating the
safe spaces we desire. They can cause us to become unwitting a-holes. While it is easy to recognize
and eschew unethical and abusive behaviors such as screaming at a colleague or intentionally harming
others, more insidious are disrespectful or noninclusive behaviors that erode trust.
<br/><br/>
Some examples of behaviors that have unintentionally negative impacts:
<br/><br/>
<ul>
  <li>
    A founder requires the entire in-person team to do their work in complete silence for 3
    continuous hours every day. No chat messages, checking email, or otherwise talking, regardless
    of whether or not the conversations are about work — makes one wonder if this is work or
    kindergarten.
  </li>
  <li>
    A CEO expects engineers to be in the office (before remote work was prevalent) by 9a sharp —
    because productivity only happens between 9-5.
  </li>
  <li>
    The head of design cancels usability testing sessions that a designer has scheduled without
    discussing it with them.
  </li>
  <li>
    A manager delegates work to a team member, only to then question their every move and repeatedly
    course-correct despite professing trust and the importance of ownership.
  </li>
  <li>
    Copying a colleague's manager on an email when asking that colleague to complete a task.
  </li>
  <li>
    Engineers take the initiative to make a product or design decision without communicating their
    intent (#2 in <a
    href="https://www.unlikely.so/10-ways-to-piss-off-your-designer-without-even-trying/">“10 ways
    to piss off your designer without even trying</a>," but all items on that
    list apply).
  </li>
  <li>
    A team member disagrees with the product or company direction but doesn't say anything during
    team discussions, only to later express frustration to selected colleagues.
  </li>
  <li>
    A team member vents about colleagues behind their backs instead of addressing disagreements
    directly with them.
  </li>
  <li>
    A product manager lobbies to fire a colleague who is not pulling their weight instead of giving
    them feedback about their performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    A leader creates an unhealthy team bond by engaging in an us versus them mentality, resulting in
    cliques and private group chats.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trash-talking clients, competitors, peers, etc., to pump up the troops.
  </li>
  <li>
    Believing what a colleague tells you about what another colleague thinks, says, or feels without
    checking with the source.
  </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
The list goes on as we can all add our experiences to this. These behaviors likely seemed reasonable
to the people who committed them. On the receiving end, we call them a-hole behavior.
<br/><br/>
What impact does suppressing our feelings have?
<br/><br/>
The leader who required silence may have meant well and might have been trying to help improve team
productivity by creating an environment conducive to concentration. They may have had any number of
feelings that led to acting the way they did, but those were not communicated. By jumping to
implement a solution without speaking to those who would be impacted, they tried to solve a
non-existent problem, creating confusion, stress, and resentment. Their actual feelings and
intentions remain unknown, but the impact of those unspoken feelings was felt. Sometimes their
impact is so painful that we are unable to even wonder about intent and instead brand those who have
hurt us as a-holes — I have.
<br/><br/>
In more instances than I’d like to admit, whenever I’ve tried to repress my frustration or anger
about a perceived a-hole, I’ve acted in ways that likely prolonged the conflict, sometimes
exacerbated it. In the face of perceived authoritarian behavior, I’ve reacted with passive
aggressiveness or open defiance. I felt wronged and excused my ensuing behavior as that of an
unjustly injured party, even though that behavior likely caused injury to others. Situations like
these create a chicken-and-egg cycle. Sometimes, the transgression might be minor, but when left
unaddressed, small things compound. The only possible outcome then is for one of us to quit when our
misery becomes intolerable. 
<br/><br/>
So AITA at work?
<br/><br/>
Labeling ourselves or others can provide temporary relief, but reduces everyone to caricatures.
Vindication is short-lived and we are eventually left with lingering resentment. It might be
comforting to rest in self-righteous indignation, but in doing so, we risk not exercising our
curiosity and avoiding attempts to connect. Resolving conflict is hard and consuming, but ultimately
rewarding work that builds trust.
<br/><br/>
One of my most transformative experiences was experiencing <a
href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/experience/learning/leadership/interpersonal-dynamics">Stanford’s Interpersonal Dynamics</a>
while in school. It gave me the knowledge needed to address interpersonal conflict. Still, it took me
years to effectively apply the lessons learned at work. Execution is hard in environments that may
not feel safe but can be done with selective risk-taking and practice. Learning to speak frankly
about my feelings and attempting to understand the underlying problem has opened me to different
perspectives, helping me to engage in collaborative problem-solving. In doing so, I have moved from
barely surviving at work to thriving and finding joy in what I do.
<br/><br/>
By not acknowledging and addressing our feelings, we act in ways that might be unfathomable to
others and trigger similar behavior from them. Learning how to hold constructive conversations, even
when it feels unsafe or impossible because of power differences, will help us to achieve outcomes
that may have seemed out of reach. Aside from not being miserable, our success as leaders (we all
are, regardless of title) depends on recognizing our feelings and appropriately expressing them
(Bradford & Robin, 2021). Learning how to effectively communicate and resolve interpersonal
conflicts improves our mental health, builds stronger work relationships, and helps us to grow
personally and professionally.

Startups often make the following mistakes in user research, especially when they lack a designer in
their early team. These mistakes can also happen in larger companies where Design is not a mature
practice and is treated more like a service organization.
<br/><br/>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Not having a budget or making time for user research.</span>
    <p>
    Not doing user research is an obvious mistake that startups can avoid. At early-stage startups,
    only the founders talk to potential users — most startups do not have the expertise to hire a
    researcher or a trained designer. Circumstances set precedents. What was regrettable becomes
    normal. When startups grow and gain the ability to do in-house research, the reluctance remains
    — I have often had to convince the teams I worked with that user research is necessary. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The early team could share the responsibility of doing user research, but talking to people is
    hard. Early-stage startups are typically comprised of engineers. As an engineer, I never spoke
    to any users. It took me a long time to become more comfortable approaching people to ask
    questions. Talking to users can be a struggle and not limited to engineers; I have worked with
    executives whose jobs were to talk to people, but even they had a hard time speaking to
    potential users. It is tempting to skip user research due to the discomfort and in the spirit of
    moving fast, but that may [contribute to the startup's failure.](https://hbr.org/2021/05/why-start-ups-fail/)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">We know our users because we are them.</span>
    <p>
    On the surface, a team may believe in the importance of understanding the target user and their
    needs, then err in thinking that more user research is unnecessary because they are the target
    users and can speak for them. However, by building the product, they already know too much to be
    representative. This would be a tricky situation that requires finesse to convince them that
    they cannot be proxies for the end users.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Using surveys to determine the feature list.</span>
    <p>
    Some teams make the mistake of creating feature lists using surveys asking users what they want.
    I have seen this multiple times and was terrified. Crafting the right questions and making an
    unbiased survey is difficult if the team has not been trained in quantitative research
    methodologies. Surveys can be helpful if the team has done qualitative research and uses them to
    falsify hypotheses. Otherwise, creating roadmaps based on survey results wastes time and money.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Pitching during a user interview instead of learning about the user.</span>
    <p>
    Startup teams are naturally excited about their ideas, so when they speak to users, they sell
    instead. Their questions ask if users would use the product, leading to confirmation bias and
    lost learning opportunities because most people will answer positively to not disappoint.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Talking to only 4-5 people.</span>
    <p>
    Startups should be wary of talking to too few users and mistakenly applying conventional wisdom
    for usability testing to user research. Most common usability issues can be discovered by
    talking to 5 users. That only applies to usability testing, not to exploratory user research. If
    the team is still looking for product-market fit and trying to understand how users might use
    the product, talking to 10-15 people would give more confidence.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Treating user research as a one-time event rather than a continuous, iterative process.</span>
    <p>
    Teams that invest in exploratory research often face pressure to achieve perfect results from
    the very beginning, especially when research is done infrequently. However, this approach leads
    to disagreements as it assumes that research has to be perfect to be valuable. When there is
    disagreement with the research findings, it may cause some team members to doubt its usefulness.
    The goal of user research is to learn about user motivations and behaviors. Research is often
    not comprehensive, as that would take a long time, so some gaps in understanding are to be
    expected. User research should be ongoing as the team tests initial hypotheses and iterates.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Not clearly defining the target user.</span>
    <p>
    Teams, especially those in the consumer space, often make the mistake of assuming that their
    product is suitable for everyone. That might be the hope and eventual outcome, but not at the
    beginning. The team must identify and define the target user. When the team fails to explicitly
    focus, it can lead to disagreements about product direction because they lack a shared
    understanding of who they are building the product for.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Being too literal in listening to the user.</span>
    <p>
    Team members who care about providing great user experiences can make the mistake of advocating
    for changes based on user feedback without fully understanding why. This is dangerous because
    the team may build something the user does not want. It is necessary to ask users questions to
    uncover their underlying needs and motivations. Users may not always know what they need or be
    able to articulate a solution, so be careful when building what they ask for to avoid wasted
    efforts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Users do not know what they want, so don't ask.</span>
    <p>
    Some teams use this as the rationale for not getting user feedback to validate their hypotheses.
    Instead, the team will build what they believe is best. Well, the purpose of user research is
    not for users to tell the team what to build — it is for the team to understand the user and
    derive insights. Once there is a prototype and users can give feedback, they can tell the team
    why it would work for them (or not). Ignoring user feedback at that stage is ill-advised.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Only the founders understand the user.</span>
    <p>
    This situation can happen if the team fails to conduct user research beyond the initial
    conversations that the founders had with potential users. The founders become the gatekeepers
    for all decisions. This may work in the early days when the team is still small, but hard to
    scale as the team grows. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The founders I have worked with were convinced they had the answers. Their confidence was
    understandable — their intuition had been validated by VC investment. It was challenging to
    persuade them that more user research was needed. I believe in acting on intuition and
    validating it with user research to keep confidence from becoming hubris.
    </p>
    <p>
    Everyone needs to have a shared understanding of the user. This is why user research should be
    continuous. It helps the team stay focused on the end user. No one person, not even the user
    researcher, should hold the key to understanding end users. Understanding the user allows
    everyone on the team to independently make decisions in their role that may have long-term
    ramifications for user experience.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  User research can seem daunting — this is why researchers undergo years of training. While this
  expertise is needed, early-stage startups typically do not have a dedicated researcher or a
  designer trained in user research. Given the typical case of a team of engineers and founders,
  there are ways in which interested team members can share user research responsibility.

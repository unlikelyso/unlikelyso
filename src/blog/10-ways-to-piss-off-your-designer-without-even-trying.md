Designers can be difficult to work with if you are unaware of the challenges that make their jobs impossible. The challenges might be unavoidable, but understanding and acknowledging them may transform a troubled relationship into an understanding, collaborative one. 
<br/><br/>
(You can use these to prank your favorite designer, but I do not recommend it unless you have a great relationship.)

    <span class="fw-700">We don’t have the budget or time for user research.</span>
    <p>
    This is a common situation — pitfall #1 in my post "Top 10 mistakes startups make in user research (without a designer)" — at both early-stage startups and established companies. Sometimes, competing priorities create budget issues. Sometimes, inertia. A designer asks for user research when there is a gap in understanding. Unless they focus purely on visual or graphic design, designers can't do their best work without understanding the user. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Asking designers to rely solely on feedback from leadership or the rest of the team is insufficient and can be misleading. All opinions are valid without user feedback, but the highest-paid opinion carries the most weight. Accepting feedback from leaders who do not have design expertise forces designers to create what they believe to be subpar user experiences, making it difficult to take pride in such work. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">I built the UI according to the specs.</span>
    <p>
    Engineers can spend so much time struggling with browser and platform idiosyncrasies to build the high-fidelity mocks that a designer creates. They wrangle with unseen challenges to meet strict deadlines and still take the time to fix awkward interactions that they spot in the designs. Yet when they push the code live for review, their designer creates a laundry list of additional UI fixes. These fixes don’t impact functionality and would take more time than might be available to complete.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a front-end engineer, I corrected design mistakes during implementation when I saw the design oversight; I didn't realize that I was wasting time and creating additional work because the designs were purposeful and optimal given the constraints. Later, as a designer, I spent long hours perfecting interactions, struggled with the edge cases, incorporated user and team feedback, and ensured that UI elements were cohesive, elegant, and intuitive. I thoroughly documented the details to make implementation easy, yet when the UI was built, it looked like someone had thrown up all over it — it was the same, and also not.
    </p>
    <p>
    All the elements were functional, but the proportions, spacing, and many other details did not match the mocks. I was frustrated to have spent all that time and effort to perfect something, only to not have it be built. I was upset until I realized that my training as a designer enabled me to see details invisible to many — that had been invisible to me as an engineer — but are essential to the experience. Designers insist on the details as fervently as engineers insist on tabs versus spaces (or the other way around). 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">This is how I would use it.</span>
    <p>
    Teams not in the habit of soliciting user feedback rely on personal opinions to evaluate designs; they should feel comfortable giving feedback on UX, but they are not the end users (pitfall #2). The team does not realize that their opinions are just that and exerts pressure on the designer to make changes. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Imagine how intense it might feel if code reviews were a communal activity where all team members (including non-technical ones) had free reign to give their opinions; without an engineering background, team members would not be able to do so. However, designs are not as esoteric, so designers are subjected to this treatment in their work. Designers sharing their work for broad feedback has merit, but the impact remains.
    </p>
    <p>
    The ratio of designers to everyone else is skewed, so there might be just one designer explaining design decisions to 10 or more people.  Multiply that by the number of UX interactions and UI elements, and the experience quickly becomes overwhelming. Endless debates ensue and are settled by leadership dictating how things should be. The subtext in these conversations is that the designer cannot be trusted to make UX decisions despite their training. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Change the design because I think team member X is right.</span>
    <p>
    Team members who do not accept that the designer may disregard their feedback might lean on the highest-paid opinion (the founders, in startups) to effect change; this terrible dynamic sets the precedent for resolving disagreements by pulling rank, leading to frustration and questionable user experiences. Design decisions based on a single opinion are dangerous, even when they have expertise — some team members claim expertise as justification regardless of whether or not they have it. To override design decisions is to strip a designer of agency and undermine them. Mistakes can be sussed out with user feedback, so when disagreements happen, it’s more productive to advocate for user research or usability testing than to wear down the designer.  
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">My family thinks we should design it differently.</span>
    <p>
    No one says this, but that’s effectively the message when they proffer unsolicited feedback from family members. Debating design decisions is hard. It's impossible to do while also trying to avoid accidentally insulting someone’s family. This is especially bad if that person is the CEO or founder. It puts the designer in an impossible position and cripples their ability to respond unless they are highly adept at diplomacy. The seeming disregard for years of training and experience causes frustration. 
    </p>

  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Can you make it look like this app?</span>
    <p>
    Teams that don’t know the value of a Design partner will involve designers too late in the product development process. A product manager may confer with engineers about feasibility and timelines from the start but neglect to include the designer. Tight timelines, shifting priorities, and overwhelming workload can lead the PM to expect the designer to take sketched wireframes and quickly turn around the high-fidelity mocks. A designer who has not been on the project will not have enough information about the problem or the target user and is then denied the chance to brainstorm and evaluate alternatives. When working with a user experience designer (aka product designer), this assembly-line setup discounts their skills and asks them to push pixels (about as much fun as being a “code monkey”). 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Why don’t we add a tab?</span>
    <p>
    Asking for a tab might be a variation of treating Design as a service but can be suggested as a helpful shortcut to meet deadlines. Tabs are fast and easy; they're also the first step to a cluttered UI in a graveyard of features languishing for user attention. Tabs are expedient and can be changed later, but that often falls off the to-do list when priorities change. Well-intentioned shortcuts lead to a confusing experience for users, and designers will bear the judgment for bad design. Asking for a tab isn't always bad, but it implies that designing experiences doesn't require thoughtfulness and consideration, effectively devaluing the contributions of a designer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Can we make it stand out more?</span>
    <p>
    When feature adoption doesn’t live up to forecasted metrics, the team will question whether users know the feature is available. They may suggest visual changes to make the feature more visible rather than reflecting on whether or not the feature provides enough value. The feature may be buried, but no number of tours or callouts will entice users if it does not fit their workflow. A designer may advise revisiting the value proposition, but they may be ignored if the team is convinced of product-market fit. Debates about UI treatments and visual design will have little impact if the team is mistaken. Under pressure, the designer yields to team opinion and creates changes that eventually prove fruitless.

  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">This article/book says we should design it this way.</span>
    <p>
    Caring about good user experience is essential for product development teams. Sometimes, the expression of such enthusiasm is difficult to understand. A team member may excitedly recount a wonderful lesson from an article and give the designer advice that effectively means: "Create user-friendly experiences." This is the equivalent of telling an engineer to not write spaghetti code. The designer will know core design principles. Being educated on something fundamental might be interpreted as questioning their expertise.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Can you do user research, interaction design, visual design, branding, some coding, and marketing?</span>
    <p>
    Designers in startups are often the only ones. They are responsible for user research, interaction design, visual design, marketing collateral, and likely more. Each of these responsibilities is a discipline with its own challenges and is a tremendous undertaking for a single person and can quickly lead to burnout. This versatility might be treated as common and expected and not compensated for what, in reality, are several roles. Wearing different hats is necessary for a startup but shouldn't be taken for granted.
    <br/><br/>
    Having honest conversations when difficult situations happen can resolve many disagreements, but it is a learned skill to do so effectively. The teams that have gone through my interpersonal communication training have found it to be pragmatic and immediately applicable, leading to more effective collaboration.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Each of these situations is frustrating, but the weight of all can make work unbearable. So when the designer you work with is upset, consider which of the situations above they might be struggling with. Or if your designer is a good friend and work has been boring you could add some excitement by testing their patience.

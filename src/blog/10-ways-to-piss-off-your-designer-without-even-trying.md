Designers can be difficult to work with if you are unaware of the challenges that make their jobs
impossible. The challenges might be unavoidable, but understanding and acknowledging them may
transform a troubled relationship into an understanding, collaborative one.
<br/><br/>
(You can use these to prank your favorite designer, but I do not recommend it unless you have a great relationship.)

    <span class="fw-700">We don’t have the budget or time for user research.</span>
    <p>
    This <a href="/top-10-mistakes-startups-make-in-user-research-without-a-designer">common situation</a> happens at both early-stage startups and established companies.
    Sometimes, competing priorities create budget issues. Sometimes, inertia. A designer asks for
    user research when there is a gap in understanding. Unless they focus purely on visual or
    graphic design, designers can't do their best work without understanding the user.
    </p>
    <p>
    Asking designers to rely solely on feedback from leadership or the rest of the team is
    insufficient and can be misleading. All opinions are valid without user feedback, but the
    highest-paid opinion carries the most weight. Accepting feedback from leaders who do not have
    design expertise forces designers to create what they believe to be subpar user experiences,
    making it difficult to do their best work. User research can be daunting, but is essential for

    product-market fit.</a>

    <span class="fw-700">I built the UI according to the specs.</span>
    <p>
    Engineers can spend a lot of time struggling with browser and platform idiosyncrasies to build
    the high-fidelity mocks that a designer creates. They wrangle with unseen challenges to meet
    strict deadlines and still take the time to fix awkward interactions that they spot in the
    designs. Yet when they push the code live for review, their designer creates a laundry list of
    additional UI fixes. These fixes don’t impact functionality and would take more time than might
    be available to complete.
    </p>
    <p>
    When I was a front-end engineer, I corrected design mistakes during implementation when I
    thought there was a design oversight; I didn't realize that I was wasting time and creating
    additional work because the designs were purposeful and optimal given the constraints. Later, as
    a designer, I spent long hours perfecting interactions, struggling with the edge cases,
    incorporating user and team feedback, and ensuring that UI elements were cohesive, elegant, and
    intuitive. I thoroughly documented the details to make implementation easy, yet when the UI was
    built, it looked like someone had thrown up all over it — it was almost the same but, to me,
    glaringly not.
    </p>
    <p>
    All the elements were functional, but the proportions, spacing, and many other details did not
    match the mocks I had toiled over. I was frustrated to have spent all that time and effort to
    perfect something, only to not have it be built to spec. I was upset until I realized that my
    training as a designer enabled me to see details invisible to many engineers (including me when
    I had been an engineer) but are essential to the experience. Designers insist on the details as
    fervently as engineers insist on tabs versus spaces (or the other way around).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">This is how I would use it.</span>
    <p>
    Teams that are not in the habit of soliciting user feedback rely on personal opinions to
    evaluate designs. While they should always feel comfortable giving feedback on UX, <a
    href="/top-10-mistakes-startups-make-in-user-research-without-a-designer">they are not the end users</a>. The team does not realize that their opinions are just that — subjective opinions —
    so it exerts pressure on the designer to make changes.
    </p>
    <p>
    Imagine how jarring it might feel if code reviews were a communal activity where many team
    members in other (possibly non-technical) roles had free reign to give their opinions. Feedback
    from people without an engineering background would likely be misguided, confusing, or blatantly
    incorrect. However, designs are more approachable by lay people than code, so designers are
    subjected to this treatment of their work.
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition, the ratio of designers to everyone else is skewed, so there might be just one
    designer explaining design decisions to 10 or more people.  Multiply that by the number of UX
    interactions and UI elements, and the experience quickly becomes overwhelming. Endless debates
    ensue and are settled by leadership dictating how things should be. The subtext in these
    conversations is that the designer cannot be trusted to make UX decisions despite their
    specialized training and expertise.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">You need to change the design because team member X is right.</span>
    <p>
    When the designer listens to but rejects a given team member's suggestion, that person may
    escalate the suggestion (e.g., to the founders, in a startup or a senior leader). This terrible
    dynamic sets the precedent for resolving disagreements by pulling rank, leading to a frustrated
    designer and questionable user experiences. Design decisions based on a single opinion are
    dangerous, even when the suggester has expertise (some team members claim expertise as
    justification regardless of whether or not they actually have it). To override design decisions
    is to strip a designer of agency and undermine them. Design mistakes should be sussed out with
    user feedback. So when you disagree with a design decision, it’s more productive to advocate for
    user research or usability testing than to wear down the designer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">My family thinks we should design it differently.</span>
    <p>
    No one says this, but that’s effectively the message when they proffer unsolicited feedback from
    family members. Debating design decisions is hard. It's impossible to do while also trying to
    avoid accidentally insulting someone’s family. This is especially bad if that person is the CEO
    or founder. It puts the designer in an impossible position and cripples their ability to respond
    unless they are highly adept at diplomacy. The seeming disregard for years of training and
    experience creates friction.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Can you make it look like this?</span>
    <p>
    A product manager working under tight timelines, shifting priorities, and an overwhelming
    workload might feel there is no time to consult with a designer early in planning and instead
    sketch out some rudimentary wireframes of a pre-conceived experience and ask the designer to
    quickly convert them into high-fidelity mocks. A designer who has not been on the project will
    not have enough information about the problem or the target user and is now denied the chance to
    brainstorm and evaluate alternatives. When working with a user experience designer (aka product
    designer), this assembly-line setup discounts their skills and asks them to simply push pixels
    (about as much fun as being a “code monkey”).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Why don’t we add a tab?</span>
    <p>
    Tabs are often a fast and easy shortcut to adding functionality without disturbing the existing
    design. But they are also the first step to a cluttered UI in a graveyard of features
    languishing for user attention. Tabs are expedient and can be changed later, but that follow-up
    work often falls off the to-do list when priorities change. Well-intentioned shortcuts lead to a
    confusing experience for users, and designers will bear the judgment for bad design. Asking for
    a tab isn't always bad, but it implies that designing experience doesn't require thoughtfulness
    and consideration, effectively devaluing the contributions of a designer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Can we make it stand out more?</span>
    <p>
    When feature adoption doesn’t live up to target metrics, the team may question whether users
    know the feature is available. They may suggest visual changes to make the feature more visible
    rather than reflecting on whether or not the feature provides enough value for the user to use
    it. The feature may be buried, but no number of onboarding wizards or callouts will entice users
    if it does not fit their workflow. A designer may advise revisiting the value proposition, but
    they may be ignored if the team is already convinced of product-market fit. Debates about UI
    treatments and visual design will have little impact if the team is mistaken about the user
    needs. Under pressure, the designer yields to team opinion and creates changes that eventually
    prove fruitless.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">This article/book says we should design it this way.</span>
    <p>
    It is always heart-warming when a non-designer cares so much about user experiences that they
    read articles or listen to talks about design and enthusiastically bring them back to the team.
    They may then excitedly recount a wonderful lesson they learned and translate it into advice for
    the designer that effectively means: "Create user-friendly experiences.” This is the equivalent
    of telling an engineer to write high-quality code. The designer will already know core design
    principles. A non-designer trying to educate them on something fundamental is likely to be
    interpreted as questioning their expertise.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="fw-700">Can you do user research, interaction design, visual design, branding, some coding, and marketing?</span>
    <p>
    Designers in startups are often the only ones doing all of the above. They are responsible for
    interviewing users, designing visuals, drafting copy, creating user flows, developing marketing
    collateral, and likely more. Each of these responsibilities is a discipline with its own
    challenges and can quickly lead to burnout if undertaken by a single person. This versatility in
    a designer might be treated as common and expected, but the designer is rarely compensated for
    what, in reality, are several roles. Wearing different hats is necessary for anyone at a startup
    but shouldn't be taken for granted.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Each of these situations is frustrating, but the weight of it all can make a designer’s work
unbearable. So when the designer you work with is upset, consider which of the situations above they
might be struggling with. Having honest
conversations when <a href="/aita-at-work/">difficult situations</a> happen can resolve
many disagreements, leading to more effective collaboration.
